The problem that our applied project aims to solve is that many hospital patients develop allergies due to a number of factors such as administration of certain medications ,treatments, their demographics, etc. By investigating a dataset from Harvard Dataverse with over 30,000 synthetic patient records, we are using Machine Learning analysis to be able to predict what factors impact developments of allergies the most.

## File Structure: 
[analyis.ipynbb](analyis.ipynbb) is the notebook with a majoirty of data visualization and exploration. This files also includes a few different ML models we tested.
[allergy_prediction.ipynb](allergy_prediction.ipynb) is the notebook with our final Logistic Regression Model.


## Data Set:

https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/BWDKXS

## Built with:
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Ppen source data analysis and manipulation tool
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.


## Recommendations
- Find clearer correlations between differenct factors and allergies
- Make more accurate predictions to reduce MSE
