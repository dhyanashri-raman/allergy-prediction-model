The problem that our applied project aims to solve is that many hospital patients develop allergies due to a number of factors such as administration of certain medications ,treatments, their demographics, etc. By investigating a dataset from Harvard Dataverse with over 30,000 synthetic patient records, we are using Machine Learning analysis to be able to predict what factors impact developments of allergies the most.
